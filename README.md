### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2020

+ Projec title: Take a Closer Look at Happy Songs
+ This project is conducted by Siqi Zhao(sz2866).

+ Project summary: 
This project wants to find happiest genre
    - On the genre level, I discovered that Jazz is the happiest genre through sentiment analysis. 
    - Compared the two happiest genres: Jazz and R&B. Under the same sentiment - Joy, I investigated the similarity and differences of happy Jazz and R&B songs from the following perpectives:
        * Using wordclouds, try to find out if there's similarity/differences in keywords used.
        * Using topic modelling, try to find out what topics Jazz and R&B are writing about under the joy category; and to discover which topic they focused on more.
        * Try to find out the lyrics repetitiveness pattern of the two genres under joy emotion. And try to relate the result to their market success.

+ Project conclusion:
    - The happiest genre is Jazz. Besides, joy is the most popular emotion among nearly all genres, except for Metal and Hip-Hop. 
    - Compare happy songs between Jazz and R&B:
        * they are using a similar set of keywords to express joy: such as love, baby, heart, etc.
        * R&B has more happy love songs than Jazz, even though Jazz has more happy songs than R&B.
        * For happy songs, R&B lyrics are more repetitive than Jazz lyrics, which aids in memory and popularity of the songs. This may probably be one of the reasons that R&B is more popular than Jazz.
